Lab 4 is a modified solution to chapter 8, programming problem 2.  The original text is as follows:

Text requirements
#################

Santa Claus allegedly keeps lists of those who are naughty and those who are nice.  On the naughty list are the names of those who will get coal in their stockings.  On the nice list are those who will receive gifts.  Each object in this list contains a name (a string) and a list of that person's gifts (an instance of an ADT list).  Design an ADT for the objects in the nice list.  Specify each ADT operation by stating its purpose, describing its parameters, and writing preconditions, postconditions, and a pseudocode version of its header.  Then write a template interface for the ADT that includes javadoc-style comments.
